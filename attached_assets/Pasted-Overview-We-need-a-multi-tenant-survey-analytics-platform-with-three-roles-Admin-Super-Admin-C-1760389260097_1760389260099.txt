Overview:
We need a multi-tenant survey analytics platform with three roles: Admin (Super Admin), Company HR, and Employee.
The access and data visibility must be role-based to ensure data isolation and privacy between companies.

Requirements
1. Admin (/dashboard)

The Admin (Super Admin) can view all survey submissions from all companies and their employees.

Admin can search employee responses using the employee response code.

Admin can view:

List of all companies

List of all employees under each company

Full details of each employee’s survey submission (each question and answer)

Admin can generate and issue certifications to employers based on employees’ insights.

Admin should have full access to analytics and raw data.

Default Admin account credentials:

Email: admin@admin.com (or similar)

Password: admin@123

Admin dashboard route: /dashboard

2. Company HR

Each company has its own HR account.

HR users can:

View only their company’s analytics and insights (not raw data).

See aggregated analytics, not individual employee answers.

View visualizations of survey insights (charts, metrics, summaries).

HR cannot:

Access or view data of other companies.

Search or view specific employee responses.

HR login should be automatically created and linked via domain-based email ID.

Example: If an employee with @xyzcorp.com submits a survey, the HR with @xyzcorp.com domain automatically gets access to that company’s analytics dashboard.

HR dashboard route: /hr-dashboard (or similar)

3. Employee

Employees submit their survey forms.

Each submission generates a unique response code.

Employees’ survey data should be automatically linked to their company (identified by their domain email ID).

Security & Data Isolation

Company-level data segregation must be strictly enforced.

HR can see only aggregated analytics for their company, not identifiable employee-level data.

Admin can view all raw data and employee-level details.

Use secure authentication and authorization (role-based access control).

Expected Outcome

By implementing these refinements:

The platform will be organized, secure, and production-ready.

Admins will have complete control and visibility, while HRs will have limited analytical access to their respective companies’ insights.
